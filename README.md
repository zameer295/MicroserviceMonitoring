# MicroserviceMonitoring
The microservice monotoring framework was added to enhance the capability of the existing system monitor application. 
The restful API's required for each performance metric is stored in a dat file and it is invoked based on the relevent
microservice. The Json O/P / parsed Json O/P of each REST API is periodically sent to a dump file for monitoring. The
O/P is also sent to a remote login server.
